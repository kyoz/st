## Requirements

In order to build st you need the Xlib header files.


## Installation

Edit config.mk to match your local setup (st is installed into the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install st (if necessary as root):

```
make clean install
```

## Running

If you did not install st with make clean install, you must compile the st terminfo entry with the following command:

```
tic -sx st.info
```

See the man page for additional details.
